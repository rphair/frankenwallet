## Air-gappable transaction building & key backup and secured browser wallets for Cardano & other cryptos

In progress: migrating all documentation and scripts from "classic" version at https://cosd.com/frankenwallet - where it has been posted for over 3 years.

This repository also contains an issue queue for suggested changes to the documentation being built here.  Unless content is marked "under construction", please report:
* errors that need to be corrected: technical, grammatical or presentational
* security issues which you think require either a fix or an explanation
* platform issues (host computer, external drives, software) and resolutions
* additional topics or applications you would like to see covered

Please submit these suggestions here: https://github.com/rphair/frankenwallet/issues
