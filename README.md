## Air-gappable transaction building & key backup and secured browser wallets for Cardano & other cryptos

This repository contains the web content that is automatically built into the official web site: **https://frankenwallet.com**

As with all security procedures, these instructions are subjective and will contain many personal preferences and opinions.  The original author hopes that more of these opinions, preferences & experiences building the Frankenwallet will be contributed over time so this becomes a peer reviewed, independently evolving community resource.

In the cases where there may be more than one preference, or additional material that would broaden the target audience, this documentation is expected to grow over time to accomodate differences and expansions in both theory and practice: so please feel free to suggest these.

### Disclaimer

The material provided here gives recommendations to combine common open-source software packages and tools (generally covered by disclaimers in their own software distributions) in a manner expected to provide additional privacy and security for potentially valuable and confidental resources.

As per general open-source licensing standards (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)), these recommendations are offered without any responsibility for loss of resources, security, or privacy that may result: even if the instructions here are followed correctly.

### Discussions

You are welcome to [submit a Discussion topic](https://github.com/rphair/frankenwallet/discussions) when you find a potential problem or improvement that you're **still uncertain of**.  The maintainer(s), with any interested community members, will respond in hope of resolving the discussion or producing a change recommendation.

### Issues

If you are **certain of** a change recommendation, or have a definite query, please check for any existing [project Issues](https://github.com/rphair/frankenwallet/issues) that match your concern: to post your feedback there if possible.  Otherwise, submit a new issue for response by the maintainer(s).  Issues especially helpful to consider are:
* errors that need to be corrected: technical, grammatical or presentational
* security issues which you think require either a fix or an explanation
* platform issues (host computer, external drives, software) you have found, along with any resolutions

### Support

As explained on the web site front page, users planning to build the Frankenwallet should already be familiar with the following topics:
1. how to install Linux: preferably the [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview);
1. how to use the [Linux command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line#readme) with some fluency (i.e. not just copy / pasting everything);
1. some experience installing your required blockchain software (e.g. [cardano-cli](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli) or [Eternl wallet](https://eternl.io)) on a conventional system.

Therefore the definition of "support" for this project is to respond to ***high level*** questions about how the Frankenwallet software components work together.  There are many other support forums for Linux software and system administration, and questions of that nature should be pursued there before submitting issues here.

The goal of Frankenwallet "support" is for a growing community of participants to answer peer-to-peer questions about how to build the best tools & workflow for security and privacy of cryptocurrencies.  Well-considered issues and discussions will help us achieve this: especially in the course of review by representative community members and subject matter experts (see [CONTRIBUTING > Review the Frankenwallet](CONTRIBUTING.md#review)).
