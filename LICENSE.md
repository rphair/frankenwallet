FROM PROJECT PROPOSAL: Why the CC BY-SA 4.0 (Attribution, ShareAlike) license?

This differs from the default "Attribution" CC BY 4.0 in that derivative works must also be open sourced according to the same license.

The NonCommercial component for Creative Commons licensing doesn't seem well suited to the open source promotion of this material, because of drawbacks given in "Wikimedia: The Creative Commons licencing scheme: NC – NonCommercial" including restricted use in academic contexts and prohibition on Wikipedia itself. Therefore "CC BY-SA 4.0" appears best to support growing communities around open source documentation.

As with all Creative Commons licenses, it also includes a well-known standard limitation of liability which makes it very clear — vitally for the persistence of this project — that users employing the Frankenwallet in the management of their secure assets will be doing so AT THEIR OWN RISK.
