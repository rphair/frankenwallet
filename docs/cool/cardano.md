This page is intended for Cardano users and asset holders who only need a "cool" environment with the minimum of routine Internet usage and settings to support web-based crypto tools.  If you don't need these, and intend to manage your resources in an "air gap" environment, go back to this section (or continue here as well if you need _both_ a "cool" and "cold" Frankenwallet):
