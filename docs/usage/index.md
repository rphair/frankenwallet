Though the Frankenwallet was developed for usage with Cardano secure operations, it should be possible to use this tool for any blockchain workflow for offline key signing and secure storage… in fact, for any secure environment in which data from the Internet and a host computer must be combined in a secure environment (e.g. for a signed blockchain transaction).

Therefore this section will discuss common features of general usage, as well as some operational scenarios for personal and professional use.  The remaining sections will cover how the environment is used for these two particular security models:

[Relaxed workflow ("cool" = Internet enabled)](/cool){: .btn .btn-green }
