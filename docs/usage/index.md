# General Frankenwallet usage (blockchain indepenent) {#general-usage}

Though the Frankenwallet was developed for usage with Cardano secure operations, it should be possible to use this tool for any blockchain workflow for offline key signing and secure storageâ€¦ in fact, for any secure environment in which data from the Internet and a host computer must be combined in a secure environment (e.g. for a signed blockchain transaction).

Therefore this section will discuss general usage, and future sections will cover how the environment is used for particular blockchain applications, e.g.:
