This page is where the HTML should be migrated as markdown from the old web site.

I cannot see any reason why the original form of HTMl should be kept... considering that it all has to be edited anyway, and Markdown will naturally interpolate vital GitHub native elements like code blocks & perhaps charts (Mermaid).
