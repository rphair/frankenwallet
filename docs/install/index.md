# Install the Frankenwallet

You will be mostly following the official instructions here:

{: .important-title }
> FYI (don't begin this procedure)
>
> [**Install Ubuntu desktop**](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)

...except for specific instructions on the next pages.Â  Since your host computer will likely be busy installing Ubuntu on your Frankenwallet memory stick, follow along the next few pages either:

1. on a mobile device (turn sideways for the screenshots!), or on a second computer if you can borrow one.
2. (for experienced Linux users only) from the next few pages saved (complete, *with images*) **into your [host folder](/prepare/#host-folder)** - which you will be able to open from your Files (file manager) application in a separate window during the Ubuntu installation procedure *and* during the first boot of your Frankenwallet.

> The latter option #2 (working off the saved pages in this section) will allow you to copy & paste commands rather than copying them by eye & hand as you would have to do from another screen.

You should *not* browse the Internet during the Ubuntu installationâ€¦ nor should you ever use the browser when booted from the Frankenwalletâ€¦ unless you have made a conscious choice to drop the security level!

### Let's begin creating the Frankenwallet ðŸ¤“ {#begin}

âž¤ Shut your host computer down.

âž¤ As a security precaution, disconnect any USB cables to mobile devices from the computer (even if you think they're just charging).Â  It is *not* necessary to disconnect any Internet connections yet.

âž¤ Attach your new Frankenwallet drive to one of the USB ports.

âž¤ Insert your Ubuntu media (usually another USB drive to another USB port).

âž¤ Reboot the computer from the installation media.Â  You should eventually get to a graphical screen where it will ask you "Try Ubuntu" or "Install Ubuntu" â€” select **Install Ubuntu**:

If you get stuck at any point before you see this screen, seek help according to the type of computer you haveâ€¦ these problems are beyond the scope of this manual.

âž¤ Follow the Ubuntu Desktop standard installation procedure: most importantly, with all the selections on the next page.
