# Advanced topic: Installing the Frankenwallet on an internal disk partition
{: .no_toc }
- TOC
{:toc}

The simple, default case of Frankenwallet installation is for it to be installed on an external drive: a fast memory stick or (even better) a SATA SSD attached with a SATA-to-USB cable or equivalent.  To increase performance without sacrificing physical security, more accomplished users may consider keeping their Frankenwallet secured inside their host computer as an encrypted, bootable partition of their internal disk.

Users thinking of this possibility will generally already have their PCs set up for dual boot between Linux and Windows.  This generally involves [GRUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB), which locates other bootable partitions when configured and allows them to be selected from a boot menu when the system starts.  To understand and implement these instructions properly, users should have some familiarity with how GRUB works from personal experience.

Though this procedure has been rigorously tested to ensure that non-experts can follow it, users also should be aware that it will shift the focus of their desktop more towards security... for instance, having an encrypted GRUB which must be decrypted with a password, with some inconvenience and delay, every time the system starts: even when not intending to use the Frankenwallet.

{: .new-title}

> Users unprepared for this can also adapt these instructions for other encrypted configurations: for instance, installing the Frankenwallet with all its partitions encrypted onto a fast external USB SATA SSD drive and leaving the bulk of its storage accessible unencrypted from the host system, as a "backup drive" would be (see [Alternatives](#alternatives)).

In any case, like the rest of the Frankenwallet instructions, this material is intended as a starting point for users to develop a secure workflow according to their own preferences and requirements for convenience.

## Common conceptions about encrypted Linux systems: and how we will improve upon them {#goal}

### `/boot` is generally not encrypted {#boot-not-encrypted}

At the time of this writing, if you search Google for [debian should not encrypt boot partition](https://www.google.com/search?q=debian+should+not+encrypt+boot+partition), its AI Overview says:

- *Debian installations typically do not encrypt the boot partition because the bootloader (GRUB) cannot access it to decrypt it, which would cause a boot failure.*
- *While it is technically possible to encrypt the boot partition, it is complex, provides little security benefit compared to other methods, and is generally considered unnecessary.*
- *Instead, most full-disk encryption setups in Debian leave the boot partition unencrypted and encrypt the root partition, which contains sensitive system files. *

Installing from the Ubuntu installer (also used by both Debian and Mint) with what it calls "whole disk encryption" will do exactly this: it will set up an encrypted volume for all system and user files but leave the UEFI and `/boot` partitions unencrypted.  This is acceptable for an external drive that's removed during normal operation, but security conscious users would recognise the following flaw if installing this way on any part of an unremovable disk:

{: .warning-title} 
> remaining security risk with unencrypted `/boot`
> 
> A motivated hacker of your host system, seeing that you also have an encrypted partition and a separate unencrypted `/boot` partition, could substitute a hacked kernel or [initramfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk) there that would provide remote access to devices or other back doors.

So, according to the institutionally promoted conception, this mode of intrusion is considered of "little security benefit" and "generally unnecessary" — even though it would provide a guaranteed means of access to your resources stored in an internally installed Frankenwallet.

Leaving `/boot` unencrypted suits the current state of the industry because the only defence against such tampering is the centralised institutional signing of boot images so they can be used with Secure Boot enabled in the computer's BIOS settings.  However, long term users of Linux will know that this signing is often delayed: and that "secure boot" would need to be disabled if ever customising one of those boot images.

Therefore it is unfortunate for our security requirements that Linux platform engineers don't consider tamper-proofing the the `/boot` partition a priority... since this is exactly how a motivated hacker would continue their search for cryptocurrency on a hacked host system.

### What can be done about it {#discrimination}

The discrimination against this idea means that there is little documentation on the subject: with a massive learning curve full of trial and error, and with Internet search providing much outdated, contradictory, and incorrect information.  The unpopularity of truly full-disk encryption (including `/boot`) has led to these practical consequences observable as of late 2025:

➤ The Ubuntu installer will only set up encryption automatically when selecting the "whole disk" — which must wipe out everything else on that disk in the process — and will still leave you with an unencrypted `/boot` partition.

➤ The selection of an encrypted partition to be used for your system and user files (root = `/`) must be done manually through an undocumented selection from a list of partition types.

➤ Though [Linux allows keeping `/boot` in an encrypted root partition](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot), the Ubuntu installer will not allow it (this is either an unjustifiable "feature" or a bug that's existed for several years).

➤ Popular procedures to install the new encrypted Linux "alongside" another partition rely on a gimmick in the installer ([illustrated here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmZYrBPVRVQ) and criticised elsewhere) which is generally acknowledged to be a bug that might be removed at any time.

➤ The Ubuntu installer will not install "alongside" Linux, so can only use the disk space belonging to Windows or another OS (or another partition, which it will never use *all* the space from).

➤ The version of encryption used by the installer, [LUKS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup#LUKS2), is [incompatible with GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#LUKS2) —and so will fail to produce a boot menu entry for that `/boot` partition even though Linux itself will be successfully installed.

➤ Even when manually creating a `/boot` partition with the compatible version LUKS1, the default GRUB configuration will not recognise encrypted partitions without a [special option being added](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot) which isn't in the default files: again, causing these installations to fail.

The instructions below will fix all of these problems and provide Frankenwallet users a means of developing this configuration.  Therefore it should be considered a "proof of concept" rather than a recommendation for all users: especially important since the concept itself is not well supported by either the Linux community or its architects.

Still, the author believes that bringing a more advanced encryption to the level of non-experts — at a medium level of detail and complexity chosen for the procedure below — will broaden the reach of workflow encryption through open source software and ultimately reduce dependence upon hardware wallets.

## Installation procedure {#installation}

These particulars and screenshots are from the latest [Linux Mint version 22.2 (Zara)](https://linuxmint.com/rel_zara.php) and its [installation media for the Cinnamon Edition](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=322) (chosen vs. the Xfce edition due to irregularities in its file manager "Thunar").  You are welcome to choose a different edition if you believe it will better suit your workflow: as long as it's Debian based, the preparation & installation procedures will be the same.

The process below follows the same general procedure as installing on an external drive (currently illustrated with the older Ubuntu installation media) from these first two steps:

- [Set up Ubuntu encrypted drive](/install/process)
- [Booting the Frankenwallet](/install/login)

... so be sure to return to the third step — once this system is set up — to continue setting up your internal Frankenwallet as you would the external one: [Secure your encrypted partition against any Internet usage](/install/settings)

{: .new-title}

{: .important}
> Also please use standard system administration precautions: like ensuring uninterrupted power for the computer and making full backups of all essential data before continuing.

### Use `gparted` to make space for `/boot` & root partitions {#gparted}

First, run the command `gparted` — either from the Terminal shell or by entering its name from the lower-left corner menu — to display and modify the partition table on your internal disk:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153032.png)

The image incidentally shows enough free space in the middle of the disk to install the Frankenwallet: but generally your computer's internal disk will have no space between its partitions.  So we'll follow a procedure to take some space out of the drive from the partition which you can see has the most free space: which in this case is the Linux `HOME` partition.

{: .highlight} 
> (please forgive the image quality for using photographs to illustrate choices from pop-up menus: which disable built-in screenshots)

We right-click that partition and select `Resize/Move`:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153059.jpg)

... to move the end of this partition back by the required amount of space:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153201.png)

CAUTION
{: .info-title} 
> be advised
>
> Moving the end of a partition backward is generally much faster & more error-resistant than trying to move forward the beginning of a partition, which contains the densest concentration of file system structure.

{: .warning} 
> If the process of resizing your partition is interrupted before finishing, your data will likely be irrevocably lost.

We create space here for two partitions (note `0` space "preceding" indicates the filesystem won't need to move: only truncating the end):

- 1GB (1024 MB) = the encrypted `/boot`
- + 24GB = the encrypted root (15GB minimum + long term space for software, optional OS updates, etc.)
- = 25GB = total to shrink the existing partition 

For those who have not used `gparted` before, keep in mind the requested changes appear in a list of pending operations below, while showing you how your disk will look afterward, but will not actually be applied until hitting the `Apply All Operations` button at the top:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153222.png)

... confirming:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153240.png)

... and waiting for the procedure to complete:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153320.png)

The result will be a 25GB space at the end of the shrunken partition:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153339.png)

We select that `unallocated` space to create two partitions within it (with the `New` selection):

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153423.jpg)

... selecting `cleared` for `File system:` to avoid interference by the OS installer or other tools, first creating the 1GB (1024 MB) smaller filesystem:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153524.jpg)

... and then doing the same to create a 24 GB "cleared" partition in the larger space:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153756.png)

Upon completion, you'll have 2 new "cleared" partitions:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153813.png)

{: .note}
> After "Applying all operations" again (`gparted` will warn you if you quit without doing that!), these will show in `gparted` as "unknown" — since "cleared" is not a filesystem state, but only a one-time procedure to confirm no filesystem traces are there:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153840.png)

### Preparing the encrypted `/boot` at the command line {#create-crypt-boot}

After quitting `gparted` we set up the smaller `/boot` partition as an encrypted device by hand: due to the restriction listed above that the default encryption method (LUKS2) isn't currently usable by GRUB (which requires LUKS1).

{: .new-title}
> confirmation
>
> You can check the distinction between the two encryption versions at this standard industry reference [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019#LUKS_Encrypt): "In summary, the LUKS container for /boot/ must currently use LUKS version 1 whereas the container for the operating system's root file-system can use the default LUKS version 2."

Open a Terminal shell and use `lsblk` to confirm the 2 new partitions you created after the end of the larger partition:

```  
$ lsblk  
```

... where you should see your two new partitions next to each other.  Be sure to note their names again, and you can copy & paste these devices into subsequent commands as necessary:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-153925.png)

First encrypt the smaller (`/boot`) partition, using the [high-security Frankenwallet password](/prepare/password-high) as a passphrase: because any attacker knowing this LUKS passphrase would be able to modify the resulting encrypted `/boot` from your host system:

```  
root@mint:/home/mint# cryptsetup luksFormat --type=luks1 /dev/<bootPartition>  
WARNING!  
========  
This will overwrite data on /dev/nvme0n1p9 irrevocably.  
Are you sure? (Type 'yes' in capital letters): YES  
Enter passphrase for /dev/nvme0n1p9:   
Verify passphrase:   
root@mint:/home/mint#   
```

Then we mount it (which will also confirm your passphrase again); noting the term here `newboot` is only a placeholder and only needs to be consistent through the installation procedure:

```  
root@mint:/home/mint# cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p9 newboot  
Enter passphrase for /dev/nvme0n1p9:   
root@mint:/home/mint# ls /dev/mapper  
control  newboot  
```

{: .note}
> There's no need to create & configure a volume for the Frankenwallet *root* (the larger of the two partitions) since we will create that in the installer screens in the next step.

However, those installer screens won't be able to use the new `/boot` without a "partition table" (likely a bug or artefact in the installer)... so to bypass this problem we take this final step of create a "dummy" filesystem there:

```  
root@mint:/home/mint# mkfs.ext4 -L FWBOOT /dev/mapper/newboot  
mke2fs 1.47.0 (5-Feb-2023)  
Creating filesystem with 261632 4k blocks and 65408 inodes ...  
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done  
```

### Apply these partitions to the regular installation procedure {#setup-ui-install}

Now we can finally run the installer program that's been placed on the Mint installation screen:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-155201.png)

The first few screens will be as in the standard Ubuntu installation — with choices the same as in [Updates and other software](https://frankenwallet.com/install/process/#settings-update), mainly avoiding anything that could be proprietary or closed-source — until choosing this selection from this screen:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-155440.png)

We will hit the `Change` button after selecting each of the resources we just created.  First, the encrypted `/boot` partition, which we will use now as an entry in `/dev/mapper` rather than the list of disk partitions further below:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-161607.png)

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-161643.jpg)

Make sure it will still be used as an EXT4 filesystem (you can reformat again, or not: it doesn't matter), and most importantly choose it to be used as `/boot` in the pull-down menu:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-161735.png)

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-161809.png)

{: .note}
> If it complains about "no partition table" before it gets to this stage, it means you forgot to a create filesystem for it as in the previous section!

Next we prepare the encrypted root filesystem.  Go down & select the larger disk partition we created and click `Change`:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-162159.png)

... and then choose this undocumented (though long supported) selection for the partition type, called "physical volume for encryption":

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-162348.jpg)

This opens up a dialogue box where you can again apply the high-security Frankenwallet password to the encrypted volume that will contain your Frankenwallet's `/` directory and all your confidential files with potentially cleartext keys: in other words certainly *use your maximum security password* again here!

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-162444.png)

After the encrypted volume is created, note that it still won't be used to contain the root (`/`) directory yet:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-162546.png)

... until you select the partition again, hit `Change` one more time, and select `/` as a Mount point:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-164046.png)

... and then you'll be ready to hit the `Install Now` button when both `/boot` and `/` show that they'll be set up as shown here:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-164102.png)

After hitting the `Install Now` button, if you've prepared properly you'll get this confirmation:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-164115.png)

{: .new-title}
> don't worry
>
> This comment that it will be changing "partition tables" is **no cause for concern** because it only applies to the virtual device for the encrypted volume (in this case, `nvme0n1p10_crypt`): *not* your disk's partition table!

This inappropriate warning is because the main option of the installer (the one we can't use)  creates a "logical volume" for encrypted partitions used for the operating system: and so it's displayed here even though we haven't set up one of these. 😜


{: .important}
> *"Why can't I just put /boot in my root, where it normally would be?"*

This seems like it would make sense because `/` is already being encrypted, and it would save the trouble of having 2 separate encrypted filesystems.  In fact, this configuration is [known to work in Linux even if `/boot` is encrypted](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot).  But if you select this in the installer, it will say:

- **Encryption configuration failure**
- You have selected the root file system to be stored on an encrypted partition.  This feature requires a separate `/boot` partition on which the kernel and `initrd` can be stored.
- You should go back and setup a `/boot` partition.

Here is a point to consider: even though it's possible (at an expert level) to merge these two partitions after the installation, due to the limitation of GRUB compatibility to LUKS1 this would also mean your Frankenwallet root — containing all your vital, high-value confidential data — would be encrypted with an older and less secure encryption method.

### Manually fine-tune the initial GRUB configuration {#fix-grub-config}

The final 2 installation screens — to set the time zone and set up your user account — are the last before the Linux software is set up, and will be as previously documented in [Enter user level information](/install/process/#user-info).

Unfortunately the GRUB building options *are not set properly to install an encrypted `/boot` partition* unless the official "Erase and install on whole disk" option is selected.  So we *must ensure manually* that the option `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y` is added to the GRUB configuration file `/etc/default/grub` at the root `/target` where the new system is being built.

WATCH OUT

- If the GRUB configuration isn't "hot-wired" with this option, the installation will fail with the message: "Unable to install GRUB ... Executing `grub-install` failed ... This is a fatal error"

This quick patch can be done in 1 of two ways, depending upon the exact distro & installer version you are using.  While at one of these final 2 screens (the time zone or user info pages), open a Terminal shell and:

➤ 1. First check if `/target` is already mounted: which it likely will be to set the new system's time zone.  If so you'll see a `/target` directory in the Terminal and file manager, and you can simply edit the `/target/etc/default/grub` file to add the following line anywhere in that file:

```  
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y  
```

(You can also add it in a separate file as in #2 below... the effect is the same.)

➤ 2. If `/target` is *not* accessible yet: open a Terminal and execute the following shell command, which will wait for `/target` to be created by the installation procedure before adding that line to a config file in the new system' `/etc/default/grub.d`:

```  
while [ ! -d /target/etc/default/grub.d ]; do sleep 0.1; done; echo "GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y" > /target/etc/default/grub.d/local.cfg  
```

{: .new-title}
> ready to go!
>
> The system installation will begin after submitting the User Info screen (on Mint) or after one final confirmation of the partitions it will use (on Ubuntu), and will generally be distro-dependent: so ensure you've done the GRUB path before your save your User Info!

When the installation is successful, you'll see this confirmation:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-192001.png)

... and if this has happened with no complaints about GRUB failing to build, hitting the "Restart" button after the installation will reboot with the newly encrypted GRUB components.

## Verification of encrypted startup & new partitions {#verify-boot}

After the installation completes — upon hitting "Restart", removing the installation media, and starting your computer again — as expected, you'll first see a sparse GRUB prompt for the LUKS passphrase for the `/boot` volume (showing its disk partition and UUID) which it needs to read before any GRUB partitions are accessible from the usual menu:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-193912.jpg)

Entering the passphrase successfully will respond like this (be prepared for about a 20-second decryption time on a modern system):

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-193943.jpg)

Then you'll see the familiar GRUB menu, in which the Frankenwallet installation will appear at the top (since ***it*** generated GRUB) — where it will also be the new default selection — and your regular operating system(s) will appear further down the menu (in this case, the author's unencrypted Ubuntu):

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-193954.jpg)

{: .new-title}
> tip
>
> Both the default selection and the ordering of items can be altered any time by regenerating GRUB in the internal Frankenwallet according to the standard Linux [GRUB configuration procedures](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2): which are Linux prerequisites & outside the scope of this document.

The decryption of the Frankenwallet partition itself (the root, not the `/boot` that we just decrypted from GRUB) will proceed as illustrated for the regular installation: ["Logging in" to Frankenwallet](https://frankenwallet.com/install/login/#login)

### FYI: why the Frankenwallet password must be entered twice {#password-twice}

If you had read the first section carefully, you won't be surprised when you are expected to enter this password a second time.  This is because the encrypted root filesystem also needs to be unlocked: in fact by the second password that you entered into the installer screen under *physical volume for encryption*.

There are standard procedures to unlock that filesystem automatically: which can be done securely since now the root filesystem, which can store a [LUKS encryption Keyfile](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Device_encryption#Keyfiles), is also encrypted.  These procedures are relatively complex and error-prone, and so would require a higher technical level if included here.  The best illustrations on setting this up in the author's experience are in these two guides:

- [Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019 > Post-Installation Steps](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019#Post-Installation_Steps) = a run-through of a the setup procedure adding this feature from OS installer media (after installing, or in the future)
- [Notes on installing Linux Mint 22.2 (full disk encryption)](https://billauer.co.il/blog/2025/10/install-linux-efi-laptop-luks/) > *Asking for a passphrase is too much to ask?* = a more modern description also linking to a number of current related tutorials

Besides the technical level, in the author's opinion this strategy is not much of a mitigation on the double password entry problem: since even with a `keyfile` users would still be required to enter the Frankenwallet password *even when using the insecure (host) system*.  If this presents a long-term problem, operators should consider the "hybrid" configuration of a bootable external partition on an SSD backup drive offered as an [alternative configuration](#alternatives) at the end of this document.

### Verify encrypted partitions from new system shell prompt {#verify-fw}

Now you can rejoice when you see, in the new Frankenwallet's Terminal shell, that your 2 newly created partitions for `/` and `/boot` are encrypted:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-203354.png)

```

### Verify encrypted partitions from insecure host machine {#verify-host}

You can especially rejoice when you see that the new partitions are also encrypted and therefore inaccessible to hackers when next rebooting into your host system; as per this view in the File Manager, and `blkid` as above:

![screenshot](/assets/images/internal-231532.png)

### Final step: Stop GRUB rebuild when host machine gets a kernel updateA {#kernel-no-update-grub}

As long as your host system contains a Frankenwallet (or any other encrypted partition that you still need to be bootable from GRUB), you will need to suppress the normal regeneration of GRUB every time your OS repositories push out a new version of the Linux kernel and its associated files.

Otherwise the GRUB regenerated on your insecure system will lose its Frankenwallet entries: and, of course, to mount these encrypted filesystems onto the host system for regenerating GRUB there would be a severe violation of the Frankenwallet principles.

Therefore the best approach is to allow the kernel updates to be installed but _only regenerate GRUB **when booted into the Frankenwallet**_... which will in turn probe for the new host kernel and insert its updated boot entry into your GRUB.

The current best practice to suppress GRUB from rebuilding when there's a kernel update, according to the consistently recommended solution also summarised by Google AI ([linux disable grub rebuilding when new kernel](https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+disable+grub+rebuilding+when+new+kernel)), is:

```  
# sudo apt-mark hold grub-pc grub-efi grub-common  
```  
which will confirm:

```  
grub-pc set on hold.  
grub-efi set on hold.  
grub-common set on hold.  
```

{: .warning}
> If you forget to do this, you'll lose access to your Frankenwallet the next time GRUB updates from a new kernel release in the insecure environment.

If this does happen, just reboot into the Frankenwallet and follow the standard instructions to [reinstall GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Installing-GRUB-using-grub_002dinstall.html); usually just:

1. `grub-install /dev/nvme0n1   # your disk without any partition suffix`
2. `update-grub                 # to rebuild GRUB from its config files`

## Removing an internal Frankenwallet {#removing}

You've already have seen how you can use `gparted` to reclaim the disk space used by those partitions, so the only other changes required are on the host system:

➤ 1. Undo the suppression of GRUB rebuilding after new kernel releases that was required in the previous step:

```  
sudo apt-mark unhold grub-pc grub-efi grub-common

Cancelled hold on grub-pc.  
Cancelled hold on grub-efi.  
Cancelled hold on grub-common.  
```

➤ 2. Then regenerate your host system's own native GRUB, which will also remove any requirement for a decryption password to be entered the next time the system boots:

```  
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1   # your disk without the partition name`  
update-grub  
```

## Troubleshooting

The most important emergency tool for Linux installers & administrators to be aware of is [`boot-repair`](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair) (documented best on Ubuntu, but working equally well across the whole Linux ecosystem) which collects information about your bootable partitions and rebuilds GRUB automatically.

`boot-repair` may need some manual work to recognise your Frankenwallet encrypted `/boot` drive (see [this issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/boot-repair/+bug/2077234) for that use case)... or you may wish to use it to restore your computer's original configuration, which will revert any special procedures for entering the decryption password before the GRUB menu and avoid having to suppress kernel upgrades on your host system.

In any case `boot-repair` is an essential item for Frankenwallet creators to know about — and an essential, commonly used tool in the Linux toolbox — so please keep this handy in any case before & after all Linux installations.

## Alternative configuration: install encrypted partitions to a larger external drive {#alternatives}

As suggested in the beginning, you may avoid the inconvenience of entering the `/boot` decryption password every time the system is booted (even when only intending to use your regular host system) by following the more common security configuration of leaving the Frankenwallet on an external drive... *but* with a high performance USB SATA SSD drive that you also use for other things like data transfer and system backups.

Technically you could also do this with a high performance memory stick, but the required performance rating for a good Frankenwallet UX would be expensive: and even then would work roughly with the Linux cache in a way that leaves it vulnerable to delays on refreshing the data that's written there.

The author has seen excellent external Frankenwallet performance through a modern, fast SSD attached with a USB-to-SATA cable as approximately shown in [this illustration](/intro/name): though specially made USB and eSATA SSD drives will of course work just as well or better.

> This is also the currently best recommended option if you might consider having a second Frankenwallet on the internal disk: or even more than two.  Otherwise you will have to go through a manual procedure to *also mount the encrypted partition(s) of all other Frankenwallets* every time regenerating GRUB on one of the Frankenwallets.

The installation procedure above easily adapts to one of these drives: perhaps more easily, since you'd only have to move your external device's data partition without the concern of making an operating system corrupted or unbootable.  Also, you would be spared any difficulty of changing the boot/GRUB behaviour requiring a password each time you boot your unencrypted system... since the device with the encrypted GRUB on it would be detached.

The setup procedure would be:

➤ Boot into your installation media as above with the external drive attached.

➤ Prepare your partitions the same way as above: either resizing your drive's data partition to leave the required space at the beginning (will take longer to shrink *and* especially to move its beginning) or at the end (generally much faster).

➤ Prepare the `/boot` partition in the same way at the command line, and set up the root and `/boot` partitions by selecting them on the external drive the same way in the installer.

➤ Make sure you request that GRUB be installed on the external drive (the default will be the internal drive!), so it can be used independently of the host computer.

➤ You will also need to add the GRUB options in exactly the same way as above.

➤ Once the device is built, no modifications to the host computer are necessary.

> You can immediately run the standard procedure for `boot-repair` (as per [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) if the installer "decides" to remove GRUB from your computer's internal disk in the act of installing it on the new drive: sometimes done to avoid a "duplicate" GRUB when there is more than one disk connected during the install. 😖

However, there is no more risk of this happening than when you likely first created a Frankenwallet on a memory stick: it appears dependent upon how your BIOS handles internal drives, the type of drive hardware, whether or not you have the opportunity to disconnect them in BIOS before the installation procedure, the generation of the installer, etc. 😎
